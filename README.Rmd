# ckutils

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ckutils is to provide some utilities for close-kin study design and implementation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ckutils from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rasutt/ckutils")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to simulate a wildlife population and a sampling-survey study of it:

```{r example}
library(ckutils)

# Set random seed for testing
set.seed(1)

# Simulate one population and study
pop_stud = SimPopStud(
  phi = 0.9, lambda = 1.05, N.init = 20, hist.len = 20, srvy.yrs = 20, k = 1,
  f.year = 20, p = 0.5, L = 10, imaf = 0.5, clvng.p = 0, tmp.emgn = 0,
  alpha = 5, clvng.ints = F
)

# Look at it
head(pop_stud)
names(attributes(pop_stud))
```
